# 17-hot-module-replacement

> Hot module replacement is incredibly cool. Yes, it will automatically refresh the page each time you change a component; however, what's particularly neat is that the state for all components will remain unchanged. Think of it like "Live Reload" for every single component in your application. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
