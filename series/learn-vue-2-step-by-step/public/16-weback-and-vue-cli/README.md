> Let's begin focusing on structure, and how you'll build actual applications with Vue. That means we're ready to learn both Webpack and vue-cli.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
